# MathJax minimal package

This repo contains the code examples used in the article https://tiborsimon.io/web/minimal-mathjax-package/. The articles main goal was to illustrate a method to reduce the original 180MB package size of MathJAX. I could achieve a 99.6% size reduction by using only __LaTEX__ input and __Common HTML__ output.

This repo contains the _MathJAX 2.6.1_ full package, and the reduced one, that is used by the example `test.html` file.

Feel free to use this reduced package to your projects.
